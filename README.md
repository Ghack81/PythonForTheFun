# Python For The Fun

Some test in Python.

A few tests in Python to familiarize yourself with this powerful language, 
it is a source of small scripts that you can always improve and subsequently 
passed to other areas to help with this language.

Some sources shared in text form generally come from the Wikipedia.org website 
otherwise I will put the link to the source(s).
